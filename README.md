# Upload the file "AsyncUDPServerAIRLabActualOriginal"
# It will return the UDP_IP

# In the optitrack_natnet-main folder, there is a file called optitrackPilot.py.
# This is used to make the blimp hover in place.
# Create a RigidBody on the OptiTrack system.
# The yaw angle 0 will be facing the positive x-axis upon creation of the RigidBody.
# Fill in the UDP_IP in the optiTrackPilot File.
# Fill in your device's IP address for clientAddress.
# The OptiTrack system will also display a server address, which you must fill in for optitrackServerAddress.
# Lastly, if you select the RigidBody and go to the Properties panel, you will find an ID number, which you must fill in for robot_id.
# Change any setpoints you would like for the coordinates for the blimp to hover at.
# Run the code and the blimp will go to those setpoints.
